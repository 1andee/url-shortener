# URL Shortener
A full-stack web app built with Node and Express to shorten long URLs.

## Project setup
From the project directory, run the following command in terminal:
```
node express_server.js
````
Once the server is running, enter http://localhost:8080/ in the address bar of your preferred web browser (and by that, we mean Google Chrome).

That's all there is to it!
